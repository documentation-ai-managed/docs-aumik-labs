## THE BRUTAL TRUTH ABOUT GPU ECONOMICS

**Key Insight:** GPU cloud is a **low-margin, capital-intensive business**. McKinsey reports that after depreciation, labor, and power, GPU cloud providers see only **14-16% gross margins**. This is NOT a get-rich-quick opportunity.

**However:** If you're smart about it, there are profitable paths. Let me show you the math.

## PART 1: GPU PRICING (Current Market - Feb 2026)

### Purchase Prices

| GPU Model | MSRP | Street Price | 8-GPU Server | Notes |
|-----------|------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| **H100 PCIe 80GB** | $25,000 | $30,000-38,000 | $280,000-350,000 | Most common |
| **H100 SXM 80GB** | $30,000 | $35,000-40,000 | $350,000-400,000 | Higher performance |
| **H200 SXM** | $35,000 | $40,000-45,000 | $400,000-450,000 | Newer, more memory |
| **A100 80GB** | $10,000 | $8,000-12,000 | $100,000-150,000 | Previous gen, still useful |
| **L40S** | $8,000 | $7,000-9,000 | $70,000-90,000 | Inference optimized |
| **RTX 4090** | $1,600 | $1,800-2,200 | N/A (consumer) | Budget option |

**Important:** These are GPU-only prices. Full server with networking, NVLink, cooling adds 2-3x.

### Cloud Rental Prices (per GPU/hour)

| Provider | H100 On-Demand | H100 Reserved | A100 | Notes |

## PART 2: THE THREE BUSINESS MODELS

### Model A: BUY GPUs and Rent Out

**The Math:**

```
PURCHASE SCENARIO: 8x H100 Server

Upfront Costs:
├── 8x H100 SXM GPUs              $320,000
├── Server + NVLink               $60,000
├── Networking (100GbE)           $15,000
├── Rack, PDU, cables             $5,000
└── TOTAL HARDWARE                $400,000

Annual Operating Costs:
├── Power (100kW @ $0.10/kWh)     $87,600
├── Cooling overhead (30%)         $26,280
├── Maintenance/repairs            $10,000
├── Space (colo or own)           $24,000
├── Internet/networking           $12,000
└── TOTAL OPEX/YEAR               $160,000

3-Year TCO: $400K + (3 × $160K) = $880,000
```

**Revenue Potential:**

```
If you charge $3.00/GPU/hour:
├── 8 GPUs × $3.00 × 24hr × 30 days = $17,280/month
├── At 70% utilization: $12,096/month
├── Annual revenue: $145,152

If you charge $4.00/GPU/hour:
├── 8 GPUs × $4.00 × 24hr × 30 days = $23,040/month
├── At 70% utilization: $16,128/month
├── Annual revenue: $193,536
```

**Break-Even Analysis:**

| Utilization | Price/hr | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue | Payback (years) |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 50% | $3.00 | $8,640 | $103,680 | 8.5 years ❌ |
| 70% | $3.00 | $12,096 | $145,152 | 6.1 years ⚠️ |
| 85% | $3.00 | $14,688 | $176,256 | 5.0 years ⚠️ |
| 70% | $4.00 | $16,128 | $193,536 | 4.5 years ✓ |
| 85% | $4.00 | $19,584 | $234,816 | 3.7 years ✓ |

**Verdict on Buying:**
- ❌ BAD if utilization < 60%
- ⚠️ RISKY if utilization 60-75% (new GPUs release in 1-2 years)
- ✓ OK if utilization > 80% AND you have guaranteed contracts
- ✓ GOOD if you get GPUs below market price

---

### Model B: LEASE GPUs and Rent Out (Arbitrage)

**The Math:**

```
LEASE SCENARIO: Source from Lambda/CoreWeave, sell locally

Your Cost (sourcing):
├── Lambda Labs: $2.23/GPU/hr
├── Volume discount: -10%
└── Net cost: $2.00/GPU/hr

Your Price (selling to India market):
├── Local rate: ₹300/hr ($3.60)
├── Your margin: $1.60/GPU/hr (44%)
└── Monthly margin per GPU: $1,152 (at 24/7)

Realistic Scenario (8 GPUs, 50% utilization):
├── Revenue: 8 × $3.60 × 12hr × 30 days = $10,368/month
├── Cost: 8 × $2.00 × 12hr × 30 days = $5,760/month
├── Gross profit: $4,608/month
├── After overhead (support, billing): $3,500/month

Annual profit: ~$42,000 per 8-GPU equivalent
```

**Pros:**
- ✓ Zero CAPEX
- ✓ No hardware risk
- ✓ Scale up/down instantly
- ✓ Always have latest GPUs

**Cons:**
- ❌ Margins squeezed (14-25%)
- ❌ Dependent on upstream pricing
- ❌ Limited differentiation
- ❌ Customers can go direct

**Verdict on Leasing/Arbitrage:**
- ✓ GOOD for starting out
- ✓ GOOD for testing market demand
- ⚠️ Not sustainable long-term unless you add significant value
- Build customer base → then consider buying

---

### Model C: DON'T SELL GPUs - Sell Everything Else

**The Contrarian Play:**

Instead of competing on GPU pricing (race to bottom), focus on:

```
HIGH-MARGIN SERVICES AROUND GPUs:

1. Colocation for GPU servers (customer brings hardware)
   ├── You provide: power, cooling, security, network
   ├── Revenue: ₹1-2 lakh/rack/month ($1,200-2,400)
   ├── Cost: ₹30-50K/rack/month
   └── Margin: 50-70%

2. GPU Hosting Services (customer owns GPUs)
   ├── You provide: monitoring, management, support
   ├── Revenue: $500-1,000/server/month
   ├── Cost: $100-200 (labor)
   └── Margin: 70-80%

3. Data Services (storage, backup, DR)
   ├── Revenue: $0.10-0.30/GB/month
   ├── High volume potential
   └── Margin: 60-70%

4. Consulting & Setup
   ├── ML infrastructure setup: $5-20K/project
   ├── Optimization services: $200-500/hour
   └── Margin: 80%+

5. India DR Site for US GPU Customers
   ├── They run primary in US, backup in India
   ├── Revenue: $2-5K/month per customer
   └── Margin: 70%+ (you have the building)
```

**Why This Works:**
- GPU prices are commoditizing (race to $2/hr)
- Services have sticky revenue
- Higher margins, lower capital requirements
- Builds long-term customer relationships

---

## PART 3: REALISTIC SCENARIOS FOR YOU

### Scenario 1: Pure Arbitrage (Zero CAPEX)

**Setup:**
- Partner with Lambda Labs/CoreWeave for GPU supply

### Scenario 3: Buy GPUs (High CAPEX, High Risk)

**Setup:**
- Purchase 32x H100 GPUs (4 servers)
- Deploy in your facility
- Sell GPU compute directly

**Investment:** ₹14 Cr ($1.7M) for GPUs + infrastructure

**Year 1 Projection (Optimistic - 70% utilization):**

| Revenue | Monthly | Annual |
|---------|---------|--------|
| GPU compute (32 × $3 × 0.7 × 720hr) | $48,384 | $580,608 |

| Costs | Monthly | Annual |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Power (400kW) | $29,000 | $348,000 |
| Depreciation (4yr) | $35,000 | $420,000 |
| Staff & operations | $8,000 | $96,000 |
| **Total Costs** | **$72,000** | **$864,000** |

**Net Income:** -$283,000 (LOSS in Year 1)

**Break-even requires:**
- 85%+ utilization, OR
- $4+/hr pricing, OR
- Both

**Verdict:** ⚠️ HIGH RISK. Only do this if you have:
1. Pre-signed contracts guaranteeing utilization
2. Deep pockets to survive 2-3 years of losses
3. Unique competitive advantage

## PART 4: MY RECOMMENDATION FOR YOU

### Phase 1: Start Without GPUs (Month 1-6)

```
FOCUS ON HIGH-MARGIN SERVICES:

1. Colocation (your 100k sqft building)
   ├── Target: 20 racks @ ₹80K = ₹16 lakh/month
   └── Investment: ₹2 Cr

2. GPU Arbitrage (parallel)
   ├── Source from Lambda/Jarvis
   ├── Sell to local startups
   └── Target: ₹3-5 lakh/month margin

3. US Partnership (DR services)
   ├── Resell US colo + India DR
   └── Target: $5-10K/month

TOTAL TARGET: ₹25-30 lakh/month revenue, ₹5-8 lakh profit
```

### Phase 2: Consider GPU Purchase (Month 12-18)

**Only if:**
- ✓ You have 5+ customers requesting dedicated GPUs
- ✓ Combined demand > 500 GPU-hours/day
- ✓ Customers will sign 6-12 month contracts
- ✓ You can get GPUs at 15%+ below market
- ✓ You have cash reserves for 12+ months

**Start small:**
- Buy 8x A100s ($100K) instead of H100s
- Test the market
- Prove utilization before scaling

### Phase 3: Scale GPU Fleet (Month 24+)

**If Phase 2 successful:**
- Expand to 32-64 GPUs
- Mix of H100 (new customers) and A100 (price-sensitive)
- Consider NVIDIA Partner Program for preferred pricing

## PART 6: KEY TAKEAWAYS

### The Hard Truth

1. **GPU cloud is NOT high margin** - McKinsey says 14-16% after all costs
2. **Depreciation kills you** - New GPUs every 1-2 years
3. **Utilization is everything** - Below 70%, you lose money
4. **Big players have advantages** - NVIDIA gives them better pricing, priority access

### The Smart Play

1. **Don't compete on GPU pricing** - You'll lose to Lambda, CoreWeave
2. **Compete on services** - Support, compliance, locality, relationships
3. **Use arbitrage to learn** - Minimal risk, understand your market
4. **Buy GPUs only with guaranteed demand** - Contracts first, hardware second
5. **Focus on India advantage** - Data residency, local support, relationships

### Your Unique Advantages

| Advantage | How to Monetize |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 100k sqft building | Colocation at high margins |
| India location | Data residency, disaster recovery |
| Low labor cost | 24/7 support, managed services |
| Government subsidies | 25% CAPEX back, reduce break-even |
| Central India | Edge computing, regional coverage |

### Bottom Line

**Don't buy GPUs yet.**

Build your colocation business first, add GPU arbitrage as a service, and only invest in hardware when you have:
- Proven demand (contracts)
- High utilization guarantee (>80%)
- Cash reserves (24 months)
- Competitive GPU pricing (NVIDIA partnership)
