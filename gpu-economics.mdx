## Key Insight

GPU cloud has **14-16% gross margins** after depreciation, labor, and power (McKinsey). Not a high-margin business.

## Current Pricing (Feb 2026)

### Purchase Prices

| GPU | Unit Price | 8-GPU Server |
|-----|-----------|--------------|
| H100 SXM | $35-40K | $350-400K |
| H100 PCIe | $30-38K | $280-350K |
| A100 80GB | $8-12K | $100-150K |
| L40S | $7-9K | $70-90K |

### Cloud Rental (per GPU/hour)

| Provider | H100 | A100 |
|----------|------|------|
| AWS/Azure/GCP | $4-5 | $2-3 |
| Lambda Labs | $2.23 | $1.10 |
| CoreWeave | $2.25 | $1.50 |
| Jarvis Labs (India) | $2.99 | $1.50 |
| Vast.ai | $1.50-2.50 | $0.50-1 |

## Three Business Models

### Model A: Buy GPUs

**8x H100 Server Economics:**
- CAPEX: $400K
- OPEX: $160K/year (power, cooling, maintenance)
- 3-Year TCO: $880K

**Break-even:**

| Utilization | Price/hr | Payback |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| 70% | $3.00 | 6.1 years ❌ |
| 85% | $4.00 | 3.7 years ✓ |

**Verdict:** Only buy if utilization greater than 80% with guaranteed contracts.

### Model B: Lease and Resell (Arbitrage)

- Source: Lambda at $2/hr
- Sell: India at $3.60/hr (₹300)
- Margin: 44%
- Annual profit (8 GPUs, 50% util): ~$42K

**Verdict:** Good for starting. Low risk, learn market.

### Model C: Don't Sell GPUs - Sell Services

| Service | Revenue | Margin |
|---------|---------|--------|
| GPU colocation | ₹1-2L/rack/mo | 50-70% |
| GPU hosting/management | $500-1K/server/mo | 70-80% |
| India DR for US clients | $2-5K/mo | 70%+ |
| ML consulting | $200-500/hr | 80%+ |

**Verdict:** Highest margins, lowest risk. Recommended starting point.

## Recommendation

### Phase 1 (Month 1-6): No GPU Purchase
- Build colocation (₹16L/mo target)
- GPU arbitrage (₹3-5L/mo margin)
- US DR services ($5-10K/mo)

### Phase 2 (Month 12-18): Consider Purchase
Only if:
- 5+ customers requesting dedicated GPUs
- Demand greater than 500 GPU-hours/day
- 6-12 month contracts signed
- GPUs at 15%+ below market

### Phase 3 (Month 24+): Scale
- Expand to 32-64 GPUs
- Mix H100 + A100

## Decision Matrix

Buy GPUs only if ALL true:
1. ✓ Signed contracts for greater than 80% utilization
2. ✓ GPUs 15%+ below market price
3. ✓ 24+ months cash runway
4. ✓ Cost of capital less than 10%

Otherwise → Use arbitrage model.
