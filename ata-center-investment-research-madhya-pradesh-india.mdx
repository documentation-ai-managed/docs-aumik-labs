## 15. US + INDIA DUAL-GEOGRAPHY STRATEGY

### The Strategic Question

**Should you start in the US first?** Here's the analysis:

---

### OPTION A: Start in US, Expand to India

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Higher revenue per rack ($1,200-2,500/mo vs ₹80k-1.5L) | Higher CAPEX requirements |
| Larger, more mature market ($138B → $382B by 2035) | More competition in primary markets |
| Easier access to enterprise customers | Power constraints (5-7 yr wait in VA) |
| Better GPU/hardware availability | No government subsidies like India |
| USD revenue (currency strength) | Higher labor costs |
| Access to VC/PE funding | Real estate more expensive |

**Best For:** If you need to build credibility, access US customers first, or want USD revenue stream.

---

### OPTION B: Start in India, Expand to US

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| You already have 100k sqft building | Smaller market (but growing fast) |
| 25% CAPEX subsidy from MP govt | Lower revenue per rack |
| Lower operating costs (power, labor) | Currency risk (INR) |
| Less competition in tier-2 cities | Longer sales cycles for enterprise |
| Growing AI/ML demand locally | Perception challenges for global clients |
| Data localization driving demand | |

**Best For:** Maximize your existing asset, capture growing Indian market, lower risk entry.

---

### OPTION C: RECOMMENDED - Dual-Geography Arbitrage Model

**The smartest play: Use both locations for different purposes.**

### How the Dual-Geography Model Works

**1. US Entity = Sales + Premium Services**
- Register US LLC (Delaware or Wyoming)
- Rent small space (1,000-5,000 sqft) in secondary market
- Deploy micro data center or partner with EdgeMicro/EdgePresence (~$1M)
- Sell to US SMBs who need low-latency US presence
- Offer GPU-as-a-Service (source from Lambda/CoreWeave)
- Bill in USD, charge US market rates

**2. India Entity = Operations + Cost Center**
- Use your 100k sqft building in MP
- Build primary infrastructure (leveraging 25% govt subsidy)
- Offer as DR/backup site for US customers
- Run batch processing, AI training jobs (latency-insensitive)
- 24/7 NOC operations (lower labor cost)
- Handle Indian market customers directly

**3. The Arbitrage Opportunities**

| Service | US Price | India Cost | Your Margin |
|---------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Colocation (rack) | $1,500/mo | ₹50k (~$600) | 60% |
| Managed hosting | $3,000/mo | ₹80k (~$950) | 68% |
| GPU compute (H100) | $4/hr | $2.50/hr (source) | 37% |
| DR-as-a-Service | $2,000/mo | ₹40k (~$475) | 76% |
| 24/7 NOC services | $5,000/mo | ₹1.5L (~$1,800) | 64% |

- Deploy EdgeMicro or similar solution
- Single cabinet or small pod
- Target secondary market (Ohio, Texas, Carolinas)
- Capital needed: $100K-500K

**Option C: Lease Space in Existing DC**
- Rent 5-10 racks in US colocation facility
- Sublease or offer managed services
- Test market before building
- Capital needed: $50-100K

#### Phase 2: Establish US Presence (Month 3-6)

**Best Secondary Markets for Entry:**

| Market | Why | Avg Rack Price |
|--------|-----|----------------|
| Columbus, OH | Cheap power, low disaster risk | $1,000-1,400/mo |
| Charlotte, NC | Between VA and Atlanta hubs | $1,100-1,500/mo |
| Salt Lake City | Growing tech hub, cheap power | $900-1,300/mo |
| Austin, TX | Tech talent, growing demand | $1,200-1,600/mo |
| Des Moines, IA | Very cheap power, Meta presence | $800-1,100/mo |

**Why Secondary Markets:**
- Primary markets (VA, Silicon Valley) have 5-7 year power wait times
- Vacancy rates in primary markets: 1.9% (nearly impossible to enter)
- Secondary markets: 15-20% lower costs, available power
- Edge computing driving demand in tier-2/3 cities

#### Phase 3: Scale Operations (Month 6-12)

- Expand US footprint based on customer demand
- Build out India facility with govt incentives

### Recommended Path Forward

**If you want FASTEST revenue:**
→ Start US reseller model TODAY (Week 1)
→ Partner with existing US DC, add India DR
→ Zero infrastructure CAPEX, immediate sales

**If you want MAXIMUM long-term value:**
→ Build India facility first (leverage your building + subsidies)
→ Enter US via micro DC in secondary market
→ Position as "US-India hybrid cloud" provider

**If you have LIMITED capital (<$500K):**
→ India colocation first (your building = zero rent)
→ US via reseller partnerships only
→ Reinvest profits into US micro DC later

**My Recommendation:**
Start BOTH simultaneously but with different capital allocation:
- **India (70% of capital):** Build out 50 racks, leverage subsidies
- **US (30% of capital):** Reseller + 5-10 rack lease in Ohio/Carolina
- **Timeline:** Revenue in 60 days, breakeven in 18-24 months
